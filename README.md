# 🚦 Road Accident Data Analysis & Visualization

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Road accidents are a major concern, leading to loss of lives and property.  
This project uses **data analytics** to study accident patterns based on **time, day, weather, and severity**.  
The goal is to generate **actionable insights** and recommend **safety measures**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify **peak hours & days** of accidents  
- Examine **severity levels** and their relation to conditions  
- Analyze the effect of **weather & road surface**  
- Suggest **data-driven recommendations** for safer roads  

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle – UK Road Accident Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- **Features:** Date, Time, Severity, Weather, Road Surface, Location, etc.  
- **File Used:** `accidents.csv`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**  
- **GitHub** (Version Control & Repository Hosting)
- **Tableau** (Prepared the same using tableau also) 

---

## 🔎 Steps Followed
1. **Problem Definition & Planning**  
2. **Data Collection** (Kaggle dataset)  
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Parsed Date & Time columns  
   - Engineered features: `Hour`, `DayName`, `TimeOfDay`, `IsWeekend`  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Accident severity distribution  
   - Accidents by time of day & day of week  
   - Impact of weather conditions  
   - Monthly trend analysis  
5. **Visualization** (bar plots, line plots, distributions)  
6. **Insights & Recommendations**

## 📈 Key Insights
- Evening **rush hours (5–9 PM)** are the riskiest.  
- **Weekends (Fri–Sat)** record more accidents.  
- Severity is higher in **rain/fog conditions**.  
- Seasonal **spikes in accident trends** are observed.  

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Increase **traffic monitoring during evenings**.  
- Create **awareness campaigns** for driving in adverse weather.  
- Strengthen **weekend enforcement** (speed checks, patrolling).  
- Improve **road lighting & signage** in accident-prone zones.
